    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Pathway diagrams represent the steps of a pathway as a series of interconnected molecular events, known in
        Reactome as 'reactions'. Reactions are the core unit of Reactome's data model. They encapsulate 'changes of
        state' in biology, such as the familiar biochemical reaction where substrates are converted into products
        by the action of a catalyst, but also include processes such as transport of molecules from one cellular
        compartment to another, binding, dissociation, phosphorylation, degradation and more. Cellular compartments
        are represented as pink boxes - a typical diagram has a box representing the cytosol, bounded by a double-line
        that represents the plasma membrane. The white background outside this represents the extracellular space.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Other organelles are represented as additional labelled boxes within the cytosol. Molecules are placed in the
        physiologically-correct cellular compartment, or lie on the boundary of a compartment to indicate that they
        are in the corresponding membrane, e.g. a molecule on the boundary of the cytosol is in the plasma membrane.
